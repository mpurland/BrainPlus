BrainPlus is a Brainfuck and BrainPlus interpreter implemented in Scala.

Instruction Set
---------------

### Instruction set (Brainfuck)
```
>    Increment the pointer (to point to the next cell to the right).
<    Decrement the pointer (to point to the next cell to the left).
+    Increment (increase by one) the byte at the pointer.
-    Decrement (decrease by one) the byte at the pointer.
.    Output the value of the byte at the pointer.
,    Accept one byte of input, storing its value in the byte at the pointer.
[    Jump forward to the command after the corresponding ] if the byte at the pointer is zero.
]    Jump back to the command after the corresponding [ if the byte at the pointer is nonzero.
```

### Extended instruction set (BrainPlus)
For information see (http://esolangs.org/wiki/Extended_Brainfuck and http://www.primaryobjects.com/CMS/Article163)
```
$    Overwrites the byte in storage with the byte at the pointer. (Extended Type I)
!    Overwrites the byte at the pointer with the byte in storage. (Extended Type I)
0-F  Sets the value of the current memory pointer to a multiple of 16. (Extended Type III)
a-z  Call function a-z, where function is named based upon location in code. (BrainPlus)
@    Exits the program, or if inside a function, return to the last position in main program
     and restore state. (Extended Type I, BrainPlus)
```
